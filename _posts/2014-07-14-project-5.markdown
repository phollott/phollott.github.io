description: Written in July 2006, "The Pig and the Box" is a book about the negative side of DRM, written by MCM as a reaction to Access Copyright's Captain Copyright campaign directed at kids. Since the text itself is now available through Creative Commons, I thought it would be entirely appropriate to <a href="http://phollott.github.io/portfolio/piglibs.html">turn it into a "mad lib"</a>, using my technologies of choice, AngularJS, a somewhat magical Javascript framework developed by a team at Google, and jsFiddle, a pastebin that operates on some of the same principles as Github, developed by a team at Mozilla.
