description: This <a href="http://phollott.github.io/portfolio/fyoa.html">Fork Your Own Adventure</a> sample combines AngularJS <em>Custom Directives</em> with jsFiddle to show how an author can easily create a short story in the form of a classic "Choose Your Own Adventure". It intentionally blurs the distinction between <em>author</em> and <em>developer</em>. <br/><br/>Written in July 2006 as a reaction to Access Copyright's Captain Copyright campaign directed at kids, "The Pig and the Box" is a book about the negative side of DRM. Since the author "MCM" has made the text available through Creative Commons, I thought it would be entirely appropriate to <a href="http://phollott.github.io/portfolio/piglibs.html">turn it into a "mad lib"</a>, using my technologies of choice, AngularJS and jsFiddle.
