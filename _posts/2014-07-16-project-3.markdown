description: My <a href="http://phollott.github.io/opendata/">Open Data repository</a> on GitHub repository contains examples I have forked and then modified using the d3.js (Data Driven Documents) library. These samples support data visualization, finding ways we can make information more visual, intuitive and meaningful. Where most d3 examples use the bl.ocks pastebin, I am storing these in GitHub, and then routing them through a Mozilla web-based code sharing tool called jsFiddle. This makes these samples easier to fork and share.
