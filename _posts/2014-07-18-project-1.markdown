description: The <a href="http://phollott.github.io/rhizome/">Rhizome GitHub repository</a> contains samples from a Mobile Health library I am developing based on an emerging information standard from HL7 called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). In particular, I have focused my attention on two resources, Questionnaire and Careplan, because I believe strongly in the value of the social health business cases they support; for instance, a mobile application walks a patient through a health Questionnaire which triggers either a Careplan involving a request to change the patient care team, or a Careplan involving a series of preventive measures, such as exercise and diet, depending on how the patient responds to the Questionnaire. These code samples also use a high level of JavaScript framework support to provide a superior user experience.
