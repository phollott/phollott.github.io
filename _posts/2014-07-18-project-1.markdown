description: My <a href="https://phollott.github.io/opendata/">Open Data GitHub repository</a> 
contains examples I have forked and then modified using the d3.js (Data Driven Documents) library. 
These samples support data visualization, finding ways we can make information more visual, intuitive and meaningful. 
Where most d3 examples use the bl.ocks pastebin, I am storing these in GitHub, and then routing them through a Mozilla
web-based code sharing tool called jsFiddle. This makes these samples easier to fork and share. Over time, I intend to
add to this repository as I discover and create more useful data visualizations.
