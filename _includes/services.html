                    <p class="text-muted">Over the last decade, I have been deeply engaged with the Healthcare industry, both as a 
					software engineer and as a standards advocate.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Critical Theory</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">My approach to literature is based on structuralist narratology: 
					theory of story structure, how narrative elements relate, how does dsicourse influence language and vice versa.
					This discipline overlaps with Healthcare when you consider that when a patient falls between the cracks in the
					health system, this is a failure of narrative at the same time that it is a failure of process or technology.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Technology Champion</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">In addition to involvement with several technical standards in the Healthcare industry, 
					I also advocate for improved User Experience with client-side frameworks and enterprise mobility platforms.
					We are watching as the web moves from desktop to mobile devices, and in turn the web is evolving from a 
					document-sharing platform to a first class application platform. At the same time, gains are being made through 
					exchange of medical documents. What we accept in the future as an interactive document is going to influence the shape of the web.</p>
