                    <p class="text-muted">Over the last decade, I have been deeply engaged with the Healthcare industry, both as a software engineer
					and as a standards advocate. A fundamental issue in healthcare is how to share information in a timely 
					<em>and appropriate</em> way, while balancing Privacy and Security concerns. </p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Critical Theory</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">My approach to literature is based on structuralist narratology: 
					theory of story structure, how narrative elements relate, how does discourse influence language and vice versa.
					This discipline overlaps with Healthcare when you consider that when a patient falls between the cracks in the
					health system, this is a failure of narrative at the same time that it is a failure of process or technology.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">I advocate for better User Experience through client-side and mobile frameworks. We are watching as the web 
                    			moves from desktop to mobile, and in turn the web is evolving from a document-sharing platform to a first class 
                    			application platform. We also see gains made through secure document exchange. What we expect now as an interactive 
                    			document is going to influence the shape of the web to come.</p>
