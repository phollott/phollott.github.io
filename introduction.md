This repository represents my approach to the Narrative of Health Informatics in terms of three axes:

+ Health Interoperability Resources
+ Open Data and Data Visualization
+ Collaborative Storytelling through Technology

When a patient falls through the cracks between Acute and Primary Care, this is not just a failure in workflow or continuity. This is a failure in narrative.
